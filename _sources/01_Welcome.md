The Second Edition of the Open Hardware Academy is starting on the 29th of September. Join us for an action-packed 10-week program that will help you develop your own open hardware project. The academy has been developed to provide participants with the necessary support and know-how to develop and publish their open hardware project. During the program you will learn about project management, documentation, community building, prototyping, as well licences for open hardware among other topics. By the way, did we mention that it is completely free ?

### What's new in the 2nd edition:
- This time participants can join with their own project or choose a challenge proposed by the openhardware.academy community. For those that want to learn how to work open source but don't have a suitable project or prototype this could a nice option to contribute to existing initiatives.
- A refined curriculum that has been updated based on feedback from participants
- Opportunity to interact with open hardware experts including past participants to benefit from their experience as well

<!-- ## What is the Open Hardware Academy?

The Open Hardware Academy is originally conceived as a 10-week program that helps you to develop your own open hardware project. In the 10 weeks participants have learned about project management, documentation, community building, prototyping and licenses for open hardware among other topics. **By the way, did we tell you itâ€™s free?**

Take a look at our [main lessons](./03_Lessons.md) with exercises.

We have designed the lessons in such a way that you can do them in your own time. 

We have also developed complementary technical lessons to develop your skills in the field of open hardware.

## Work on a challenge

**To onboard you in our academy it is good enough for us to know that you would like to work on a challenge.**

We suggest you to have a short list of 5 to 3 challenges that you feel can be a good fit for you. Once you are onboarded in the program and you have a better understanding of the challenges you can choose one to work on. We expect this to happen in the first two weeks of the program. There might be an opportunity to for example join a team, or that several people work on the same challenge.
