# Code of Conduct

## Part 1. Introduction
We value the involvement of everyone in the community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in Open Hardware Academy activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Open Hardware Academy including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as Discord, GitHub, and Twitter.
The organisers of the Open Hardware Academy are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They can be contacted by emailing delftopenhardware@gmail.com. 

## Part 2. The Open Hardware Academy code of Conduct
The Open Hardware Academy is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is either disrespectful to our mentors, participants or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.
Everyone who participates in the Open Hardware Academy activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces managed by Open Hardware Academy including, but not limited to, workshops, email lists, and online forums such as Discord, GitHub and Twitter. 

### Part 2.1 Expected behaviour
All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all Open Hardware  Academy events and platforms:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

### Part 2.2 Unacceptable behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants at any Open Hardware Academy event/platform include:
- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
- violent threats or language directed against another person
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- insults or put downs
- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- excessive swearing
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

### Part 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable behaviour
Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any Open Hardware Academy events and platforms, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform, or impose other appropriate sanctions.
