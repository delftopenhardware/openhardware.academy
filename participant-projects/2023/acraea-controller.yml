title: Acraea Control using an ESP32
description: "ESP32 microcontroller, Temperature and humidity sensor, Ultrasonic sensor,
  pumps, relay"
intended-use: "Program to monitor and control the flow of seawater through Acraea. Acraea is
  a an open source small scale solar desalination and water purifier prototype.
  This plant takes heat as input on one side and uses it to boil sea water. This
  water is then collected on the other side through condensation and allowed to
  flow out of the system as potable water."

  - Water Purification
  - ESP32
development-plans: The project is being actively developed. We are adding cloud based logging as a feature to continously monitor the performance. We are also migrating the codebase to use environment.
